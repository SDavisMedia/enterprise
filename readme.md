Enterprise Theme - Private
-----

**Don't share this theme with anyone.** If you're reading this, it's because I gave you access to the private repo for testing and development. Thanks for helping!

Enterprise is super simple. All of the theme options are in the customizer so you can test them there.

Notes
---

* **Do as much testing in the customizer as you can WITHOUT saving any options. We want to concentrate on the theme's behavior before anything is setup. It needs to work then too.**
* There's a set featured image size of `738px` by `200px` (scaled in proprotion) so if the featured images don't display that way in your test data, regenerate thumbnails, yo.
* There's a CSS class for highlighting menu items. It's `highlight`. Test it by adding that to the CSS Class field for any menu item. Try both top level menu items and nested ones... then both of their responsive behaviors.
* The Feature Box has 2 main parts. The first part is just a title and text area. The second part, which is hidden by default, is opened up with the toggle button. The toggle button will only appear if there's content in the hidden section, which is what the three Feature Box widgetized areas are for. If at least one of the three Feature Box widgetized areas has a widget, the toggle button will show. (**note:** You can force the toggle button to show as well with a checkbox option in the customizer. This will be handy when I add a hook to the hidden content area for people to put their own custom content in there and not use the widgetized areas.)
* Thanks! You are appreciated. Of course, use the theme if you'd like. Everyone else will have to pay. :+1:
